# donut

This repo is an investigation on the very cool code by Andy Sloane back in 2006 that makes a doughnut render in the terminal using C <br/>
Code is also in the shape of a doughnut <br/>
Really interesting read on the [project](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html)<br/>
I have files on the original code and will look into how the code has evolved throughout the years <br/>
I will try to break down the code and see what else I can do using this doughnut as a baseline <br/>
I might even try to rewrite this code in another languages

To run this code, compile using (change [variant] to one of the donut c files): <br/>
```
gcc -o donut donut-[variant].c -lm
```
then run using: <br />
```
./donut
```
