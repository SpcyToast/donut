# donut

Make a doughnut render in the terminal using python <br/>
Code is also in the shape of a doughnut <br/>
Really interesting read on the [project](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html)<br/>
Personally will try break down the code and see what else I can do using this doughnut as a baseline
